## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

For this project I learned how to implement grid and reinforce my knowledge of async javascript. For this project I also tried to implement a class, I did find it to be an interesting challenge and will try to find more ways that I might be able to implement classes in the future.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to study css grid, strengthen my understanding of async javascript, as well as try to better understand how I can incorperate classes into my projects.
